Goal
This take-home project is designed to evaluate your ability to tackle real-world challenges
similar to those you would encounter in our engineering roles. Beyond gauging your technical
skills, we aim to understand your problem-solving approach, creativity, clarity of documentation,
and your ability to articulate your decisions. The solution method for this project is intentionally
left open-ended, to give you the room to showcase these facets.
Estimated Time: You are expected to spend around 4-6 hours, but feel free to go over as you
wish.
Introduction
Acme Corp. is negotiating a multi-billion dollar acquisition and wants to conduct due diligence by
placing all the relevant documents in a virtual Data Room. A Data Room is an organized
repository for securely storing and distributing documents. You can take inspiration from Google
Drive, Dropbox, Box, etc., for UI/UX where the Data Room is the top-level folder or drive.
Our goal is to develop a Data Room Software MVP that works well out of the box. We ask that
you optimize for (in this order):
● User experience and functionality - make sure UX flows are intuitive and easy to use,
handle edge cases and error states
● Design and polish - make sure the design looks clean, don’t include unimplemented
features
● Code quality and readability
Instructions
Technical Requirements
● Build a Dataroom frontend single page application,
○ you can use any react based frameworks (we use React / TypeScript / Tailwind/
Shadcn for our client)
○ Allow users to create Datarooms and upload files
○ If you’re using React, checkout the simple React Setup Guide at the bottom of
this page Frontend Takehome

● You can also use off-the-shelf boilerplates code (e.g., create-react-app) or even use AI
to write code.
● Your solution should work end to end
● You can mock your CRUD data being sent to and from the server in json, indexDB or
something else

While designing your solution, think of
● Good data structures to store metadata and state, designed to support functional
requirements
● Edge cases, ex: uploading files with the same name etc
● Granular react components
Functional Requirements
Below is the main CRUD functionality you should build for
Folders:
● Create a folder and can nest folders in another folder
● View folders and their contents, this includes nested files and folders
● Update the folder name
● Delete a folder and its nested folders and files
Files:
● Upload a file, you can support only pdf files for now and can store it in browser memory
(mock)
● View file in UI
● Update a files name
● Delete a file
(Optional) For extra credit:
We ask that you time-box your solution and only attempt the below if you have time remaining
● You can deploy both frontend and backend to the hosting platform of your choice, store
the files in blob storage, thereby making this app publicly accessible.
● You can add an authentication layer using social auth or user/password
● You can add search and filtering features that allows users to search for documents
based on contents or file names.
Deliverables
1. Code files (required): A github repo with your code and a README discussing your
design decisions and clear setup instructions
2. Hosted URL: we recommend using Vercel for this

Vercel Setup Guide

You can create a free account on Vercel for hosting your submission.
1. Sign up for a free account on Vercel&#39;s website and sign up using your GitHub, GitLab, or
Bitbucket account for easy integration.
2. Link your Git repository: Once logged in, import your Git repository containing your
React/Next application.
3. Deploy your application: Vercel will then build and deploy your application. You&#39;ll be
provided with a unique URL where your application is live and publicly accessible. Share
this URL with your submission

React Setup guide
Here are the steps to set up a React single-page application using a template:
1. Install npm: npm is a package manager that will allow you to install JavaScript packages
that your application may require.
2. Create a new React application: You can do this by running npx create-react-app app-
name in your terminal. Replace &quot;app-name&quot; with the name you want to give to your
application.
3. Navigate to your new application: Use the command cd app-name to go to your
application&#39;s directory.
4. Start the application: Run npm start to start the application. Your application should now
be running at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
